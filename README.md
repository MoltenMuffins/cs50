# CS50x - 2020

> On [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/): If you are currently taking this course, or are planning to take this course in future, I would advise against looking at my solutions. If you need help with any of the problem sets, I would instead reccomend getting help from one of the many [communities](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/communities/) dedicated to cs50.

This repositiory represents my working progress on the 2020 iteration of the [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/) course run by Harvard University.
